    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sloppy Joes are a beloved American comfort food consisting of seasoned ground beef in a thick, tangy tomato-based sauce, typically served on a soft hamburger bun. This easy-to-make meal is perfect for casual dinners, potlucks, or feeding a crowd.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>¾ cup ketchup, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard, or to taste</li>

        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 hamburger buns, split</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir lean ground beef in the hot skillet until some of the fat starts to render, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and bell pepper; continue to cook until vegetables have softened and beef is cooked through, 3 to 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and garlic powder; season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide meat mixture evenly among hamburger buns.</li>
